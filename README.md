# Autoencoders

-> Autoencoder (AE) is a class of artificial neural network models that learn in an unsupervised manner  
-> It tries to reconstruct its input at its output, essentially requiring no additional label for training  
-> AE learns the underlying patterns in data and represent them in latent space    
-> Different types of autoencoders  
    i. Denoising autoencoder  
    ii. Sparse autoencoder  
    iii. Deep autoencoder  
    iv. Contractive autoencoder  
    v. Undercomplete autoencoder  
    vi. Convolutional autoencoder  
    vii. Variational autoencoder  
-> Applications include  
    1. Feature extraction  
    2. Dimensionality reduction  
    3. Filtering noise and reconstruction of data  
    4. Concise representation (reduced size) of data  
    5. Generation of new data from learned latent space distribution
